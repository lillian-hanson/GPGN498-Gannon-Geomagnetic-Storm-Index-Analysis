# GPGN498 Final Project: Gannon Geomagnetic Storm Index Analysis
#### *Author: Lillian Hanson*

### Summary:
This project analyzes the Gannon geomagnetic storm of May 2024. Statistical comparisons are made for X-ray flux and magnetic field data from the geomagnetic storm. This comparison will show a numerical relationship, if any, between these indices.  

### Tools/packages used:
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/)
- [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)
- [Cartopy](https://pypi.org/project/Cartopy/)


### How To Use This Repository:
This repository contains two main Jupyter Notebook files, figures.ipynb, and stat_analysis.ipynb, each in the /notebooks folder. The figures notebook contains all the code necessary to reproduce all the figures used in the final report. The stat_analysis notebook contains all the code required to run statistical analyses used in the final report. INTERMAGNET data can be found in /intermag-data, and all other data can be found in /misc-data. Use of this repository should be supplemented with the research paper submitted for this course.
